## Data visualizations in the wild[^1]

[^1]: This assignment is based on an assignment from [Amelia McNamara's STAT 336 course](https://ameliamn.github.io/STAT336/viz_in_the_wild.html)

At this point in the semester, you've been noticing news stories or pop sci reporting about women/females in sports and athletics. Looking through your notes, select one data visualization or chart that you want to present to the class.

You will do a *2-minute* presentation on your visualization, in front of the whole class. In your presentation, you will need to describe what the visualization shows.

At the very least, be prepared to point out...

-   What points are being made, and what questions might you have?

-   What assumptions or claims about biology, anatomy, or physiology are being made?

-   What evidence is being used?

This is a very short presentation, so I want it to be low-stakes. You should practice your presentation to make sure you can complete it in the time allotted, but it can be conversational.

This is a presentation without slidesâ€“ you will bring the visualization up on the screen by using a weblink, and talk us through the visualization. You may want to zoom in on elements, but everything should be using the original visualization.

To ensure that everyone selects a different visualization, please fill out this form to claim your visualization. Everyone should check the spreadsheet to make sure the visualization you want to use is available.
